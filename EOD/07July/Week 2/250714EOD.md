## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - Ms. Kim has given me the new GCP/Firebase Project for QA, what's my next step for this again?
  - I have a ticket in BL Enrollement Airtable to basically create field that checks if First Name and/or Last Name matches the one in Payorlink Member Name field. Although I have already created a formula field that gets the First and Last string of Payorlink Member Name field and compare this to First Name and Last Name respectively, I don't know the approach if I am going to consider Suffixes, Jr., Sr., I, II, III, etc. in the end.
