## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - I was able to parallelize the redaction on a file level only. When I benchmarked it, it only reduced to around 1s per file only. The way we can do parallel process in OCR and redaction is to move the decrypted_scripted outside decryption. Below is the recorded time:
    - Sequential: 12.4s per image
    - Parallel: 10.8s per image
  - I also deviated by changing the actual content of image_redactor.enc, since the decrypted_data uses a package, presidio_imaga_analyzer, that needs spaCy, which runs the actual redaction, under the hood. During the run time of exe file, it isn't able to find this spaCy package despite bundling it during pyinstaller. What I did was I modified this decrypted_data to not use presidio_image_analyzer.
## Done:
  - MH:
    - Teleconsult:
      - Do E2E of prod-preview
  - PH:
    - OCR:
      - Convert python script into exe
      - Create new .sh for converting into exe; 
      - Create decryptor script for new .enc file
      - Modify image_redactor.enc to remove presidio package
      - Fix diretories reference for the exe file
      - Convert the sequential redacting to parallel
      - Test batch redaction process; Benchmark parallel and sequential
