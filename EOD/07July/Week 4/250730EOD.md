## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - How do I post my Output for OCR Redaction in IT Output? Do I just post my deviation, benchmark time and usage, and support needed? I also changed the threads to get all threads - 1. So since my current MacBook Pro has exactly 8 threads, it will use 7 threads. I also made it to convert it back to PDF in the same script.
  - Is it also possible for the Multi-factor authentication to be enabled in the project MGWEB-TEST?
  - I've amended my change pala in Medicine Request for the bug fix in the new fields when new medicine is added
