## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - I've pushed my changes for MS CLEAR. This includes the rendering of AT Form and Auth, although the redirects are hard-coded. I've also added a new env variable, NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT="Inspiro", as this is how each clients are sourced in ce-consumer. What will be my next step for this?
