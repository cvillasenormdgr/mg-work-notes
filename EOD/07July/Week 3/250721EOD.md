## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - The whitescreen on BL Website Enrollment seems to be fixed. The issue is due to query error of the images on render. Last week, I tried changing the sourcing into static one, manually importing the image instead of through GraphQL and this seems to fix the issue. Should we change all of the image sourcing to this?
