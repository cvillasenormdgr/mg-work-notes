## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - Correct me if I am wrong. Basically, what happens in redecking is someone will redeck the consultations in Airtable, change the Doctor MedGrocer Email. When an MD clicks a consult, we compare the doctor assigned on Firestore and Airtable. If different, we show the Redecking Modal. However, it will still show on the incomplete tab because the "Consulting Professional Email" in Firestore is still the previous doctor but when the new MD clicks this consultation, the "Consulting Professional Email" will be updated therefore removing it from the previous MD's record.
    - What we want:
      - Change the firestore document "Consulting Professional Email" during onClick of the consult; or
      - during redecking in airtable?
