## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - Based from the Make automation you sent me, I noticed that the field "New Consult Risk Assessment" is just the "Post-Conuslt Risk Assessment", since there's already a linked record field for Post-Consult in Consultations, can I just make "New Consult Risk Assessment" field into a Lookup instead? Same with "New Consult Recommended Date"
  - May I know who uses the header "Cross-Origin-Embedded-Policy" in Best Life Website? This might be the cause for the video error in Home. Is it also possible to set the CORP of the video as "cross-origin"?
  - I added the "Specialist Details" field in FormReferral in MGX-AIMER, will consults from WN-AIMER be affectef with this change?
  - Do you know the possible context of this task? "Duplicate Base for SGD Labs Extractor". This was a note from June 05 IT PHTH Core.
