## Support Needed (3Ds):
    [Document Reader Pipeline]
        - Since I can't seem to make the package for Vertex AI Pipeline, I just used REST API call instead. Also. The body params for the REST API call, templateUri, doesn't seem to work so I just created a json file for the pipelineSpec.
        - Does the scanned images/files become bonus since these were not extracted originally or do I still need to extract these as test cases?
    [Co-pay Airtable]
        - Do we go through with the PROD deployment on Wednesday?
