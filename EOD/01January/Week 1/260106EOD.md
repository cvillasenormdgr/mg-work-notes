## Support Needed (3Ds):

- Bumping lang ulit if I can have a dedicated service account in GCP that has access to VertexAI, Cloud Storage/Bucket, and Document AI? I'm stuck lang in uploading files to GCS in the pipeline. The current one I use is the default one for VertexAI, which is 705203881520-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
