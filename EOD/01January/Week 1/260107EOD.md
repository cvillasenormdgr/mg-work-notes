## Support Needed (3Ds):
    - I can't continue with the pipeline for document reader as I need these permissions for the service account:
        - roles/aiplatform.user
        - roles/documentai.apiUser
        - roles/storage.objectAdmin
    - Do we have an SBS for duplicating bases in Airtable or can I duplicate the [DEV] Delivery Receipts as is? What should I also name the duplicated base?
