## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - I've encountered an error during "Request Prescription" in AIMER. The schema for WN-AIMER is with Daily Intake, Name, Quantity, and Sigma. However, when the consult is from AIMER COC, it returns me a record id of the medicine, which breaks in FormMedicine. Not sure what I should do with this.
  - Same with Refer to Specialist. The current FormReferral only includes: Specialist Type and Reason For Referral, while TH-AIMER has Specialist Details. Do I add this to all or create a conditional rendering based on consult type?
  - I've also updated the validation for MXC Number to align with Web Content. Not sure if there will be conflict in WN-AIMER.
