## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - I have a ticket in WN-AIMER where there's basically a latency issues on some form fields. See attached photos below. Is it okay if I start memoizeing some components/variables in <GeneratedForm>? Not sure if this will make it better or reduce latency.
  - I've also removed the "Contact us" Link on the 404 page that redirects to /help-center#contact-us as well, is this correct? See attached photo below.
  - I've added a new field in [DEVELOP] Teleconsult Form Fields "Is Option Sorted" for conditional sorting of FormCheckbox and FormRadio options for this ticket, https://airtable.com/appzIxYjHzCpJn0Vv/pagnoYpYE0sI3xjDM?detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWd6NmtkZlM4VkFZaVZTdiIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjaXZGc0FLd1V0VXlMU2MiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOm51bGx9&uxBEo=reclRhYGDDCEybgLF, is this okay?
