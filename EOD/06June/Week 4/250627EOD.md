## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - Can you explain to me the general flow of how the DR, CSV, and Picking List go through from ops to ops for Med Req? My current understanding is the Med Req Ops gets the CSV and the Picking List(not sure where) from the Med Req Base. This will be passed to PS for the document printing I assume, then passed down to SC?
