## Support Needed (3Ds):

- I have the ticket for Prescription Remarks in WN AIMER in "For Merging", can you please deploy to develop? Thank you!
- Another deviation that I might have to bring up for tomorrow's alignment in PH. I only included those medicines that will be served, meaning they don't fall under the exceeded quantity, ineligible, and out of stock, in the medicine level discount. The behavior before is that as long as a medicine is toggled on, it will show in the order prices section.
