## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - I have some confusion lang with regards to the auth process in CLEAR:
    1. In "Auth User", during the sign-in process, we are already getting the site based off of the email used for logging in, so, "//compare user.email to site["MedGrocer Email"]" this will always be true.
    2. In "Match Site Record", //compare site["Account Name"].toLowerCase() to account["Base Route"], this is also filtered out already on the sign-in process, therefore, will always be true when it reaches this code.
    3. Added a comment as suggestion for codeplan in my PR
  
  - I have a new PR for TH-AIMER in the calendar, PR #474
