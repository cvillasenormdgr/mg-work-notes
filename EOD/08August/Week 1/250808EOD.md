## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - I have one prod failed ticket in Bestlife, modal responsiveness. It appears that the "h-fit" className doesn't work or is depracated on mobile which forces the height to be the smallest. While, I manage to fix this, it made it so that in desktop it will overflow and not take the full height of the modal, is this okay?
