## Support Needed (3Ds):

- I've redacted around 180 files na, please let me know if I could proceed with the redaction of 20k files.
- I've deviated pala with the linking of records from Medicine table to Forward Co-pay Inventory. While BV ask us to create an automation, I've just linked all the records from Forward Co-pay Inventory table with their corresponding counterpart in the Product List and just rolled up the Remaining Stocks from there. I did this as the automation does not proactively look or show the remaining stocks for newly added medicine in the OV.
