## Support Needed
  - Need feedback for the revised DFD for Best Life. See attachment below.
  - When using REST API, it appears that the airtable will automatically ignore those columns with no data, compared to graphql who will just return it as null. Will this affect the initialState and formFields?
## Done
  - Best Life:
    - Tested All forms locally and in PROD
    - Applied REST API sourcing in Follow-up Labs Pages
    - Modified DFD based off of sent DFD Format
  - Sitemaps:
    - acn-website
    - mh-xa-website
    - mgx-aimer-website
  - Shared Telecon: 
    - Modified container layout
    - Read chakra-ui/react theming docs
## To do
  - Shared Telecon: Spring Planning
  - Shared Telecon Interface Code Review
  - Acuity form theming and layout
