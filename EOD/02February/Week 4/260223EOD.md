## Support Needed (3Ds):

- [BL Enrollment]:
  - For the Coupons table in Enrollment Base, I just created a sync table from IT Coupons v2, and created a linked record column for Enrollees, is this correct?
  - Also I've synced all coupons, do I create a view inside IT Coupons v2 base for Co-pay Coupon Code or should I do this in Enrollments base instead?
  - Where do I get the criteria for Co-Pay Eligible BLD?
  - What's the difference between the "Sync Best Life Diagnosis" button in Enrollments base to the "Sync Successful Consults To BL Enrollment" automation in BLD AIMER base?
- [PH DR Printer]:
  - Could you remove the shared access of api+airtable.dev@medgrocer.com in PROD base?
