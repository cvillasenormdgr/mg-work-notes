## Support Needed
  - I can't seem to access Shared Telecon AIMER Interface
  - When accessing the acuity link, it shows 'Online scheduling is not currently available', is this the normal behavior?
  - For clarification, I don't have to change anything in the forms, I just have to integrate (prefill) acuity when submitting?
  - Can I also have access to [DEV] Best Life Web Content for testing?
## Done
  - Sitemaps:
    - Cloned all necessary repository
    - List final routes of the following:
      - th-mrg-website
      - mg-heart-website
      - pp-ns-website
      - pp-jn-website
      - ep-vts-website
  - Shared Telecon:
    - Clone and run locally th-share-telecon-website
    - Access web configuration airtable
  - CV <> AA Calendly/Acuity Overview
## To do
  - List the final routes of the remaining repository/website
  - Try to deprecate graphql sourcing (per page)
  - Embed acuity in Patient Intake Form
