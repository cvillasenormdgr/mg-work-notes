## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - [ACN]:
    - For the on build of staticData.json, do I mirror this with AIMER, where on yarn run:develop, it will create a staticData.json? Do I also add the option where the user can pick which data they want to re-fetch? The current implementation is that the code is run via a separate script.
