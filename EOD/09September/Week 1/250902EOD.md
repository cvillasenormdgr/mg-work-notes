## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - I've created the SBS for the BL AI Assistant and shared it with you, can you check if it's correct?
  - I've also managed to create a server function that creates online meeting in MS Teams via Azure Graph API. My current limitations is it doesn't create a calendar, this is another separate endpoint, /me/events, and needs another permission.
