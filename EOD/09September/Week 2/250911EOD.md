## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - We noticed an issue in Enrollment for Best Life: if a user selects “I have never smoked”, the Smokes field still defaults to “No.” When I checked the formula for smoking, it seems the Smoking Frequency field only recognizes “I don’t currently smoke” as the option that sets Smokes to “No.” Is this a bug? cc:
