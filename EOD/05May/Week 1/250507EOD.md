## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - Based from the web content, the new flow would be -> verify-email -> sign-up -> enrollment -> PRIME forms?
  - For the enrollment, there is a "Personal Email" field. Is this a different field for email? If yes, should I use the email they used to sign-up and add another field in the document called "personalEmail"?
  - How do I push my changes to PRIME? Should I checkout to a new branch, push that, and create a PR?
