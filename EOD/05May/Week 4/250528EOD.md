## Support Needed (3Ds):
  - The Send Post Consult Automation that we currently have has conditions depending on consult type and if medicines are existing. Furthermore, we have a feature in the automation that sends the NPS form 5 mins after the post consult email. So do we still proceed with Zendesk API or continue with the Make automation?
    - Option A:
      - We keep using Make
    - Option B:
      - Zendesk API; will set SBS with Andy or Echo
    - Option C:
      - We store the spiels in Airtable and fetch during sending of email
  - For TH-AIMER's document generation, I just copied WN-AIMER current implementation where you have a seperate radio for each document and a follow-up question. Is this correct?
